Array is data structure which store similar data types only 1 particular type of data onlyyy

To declare an array of size 6:

int arr [6]

when u define an arary garbage values of 6 which we cant predict are stored in memory
if we define an array outside main i.e global all 6 will hold value 0 

max we can define is 10 to power of 6 
int arr [10^6]
if we declare globally max size is 10^7

to access an array we use index 0 to n-1

for i =0 ; i<n, i++
when we define its stored in random x address location which we cant predict 
but next index is stored in x+1, x+2 i.e contageous memory location
